##How to test the API calls?
1. Get Postman from [here](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) for your favorite browser or platform.
2. Read the documentation of the API calls [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/368737/candid/2Qrrxd).
3. Get the collection [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/43bc1ce69e009244415c) and play around with it.

##Why am i doing this?
I've seen the [Repost Statistics Bot](https://imgur.com/user/RepostStatistics) for [Imgur](https://imgur.com) by SleepProgger and i was fascinated by his community work. Then about 2 months later i started using candid and quickly realized that i want to use some kind of API.

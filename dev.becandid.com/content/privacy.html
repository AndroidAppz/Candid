            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Broad Overview</h2>

<p>Candid takes your privacy very seriously.</p>

<p>All personally-identifiable information sent to Candid is first scrambled via a one-way hash that we cannot decrypt.</p>

<p>We support your right to securely and anonymously communicate with others.</p>

<h2>Fine Print</h2>

<p>This policy regarding our privacy practices (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we treat the information we receive when you visit or use the Candid website, or Candid’s other domains, products, or mobile applications (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

<h3>Storing Data</h3>
<p>Candid stores only the data it needs to function properly. Candid does not store any information that can personally identify you. We do not store your IP address or precise location data. Facebook or contact information that you connect to Candid is irreversibly encrypted and is only used to highlight posts and comments from friends.</p>

<h3>Deleting data</h3>

<p>You may delete and disavow your account at any time. Deleting and disavowing will permanently disable access to your account by anyone, and delete all group memberships and friend information from your posts and comments.</p>

<h3>Aggregated and/or non-personal information</h3>

<p>We may share aggregated or de-identified information with third parties, for the sole purposes of crash reporting and measurement to ensure the smooth functioning of the service.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service, or advances in technology. Please review the changes carefully. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you consent to and accept those changes. If you do not consent to such changes you can delete your account by following the instructions under Settings.

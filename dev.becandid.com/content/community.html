            <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
<p>We want to make sure Candid is a place where everyone can speak their mind freely, not just a select few. Open, interesting and candid discourse is only possible with moderation.</p>

Here are Candid's rules:

Please do not contact Candid users for commercial purposes without their prior consent.

We do not permit solicitation and blatant self-promotion of your social media accounts and commercial goods and services. Any sort of advertising including referral links is not permitted.

<h4>Legal</h4>
You cannot post anything that is illegal in your country or in the United States.

<h4>Porn And Nudity</h4>
It is really simple: Apple and Google have strict guidelines against porn. So posting porn is not allowed.

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
You cannot post or request personal information.

The quality of posts is extremely important to this community. Contributors are encouraged to provide high-quality and informative content.
Low-quality posts and comments will be filtered. There is a a specific group "Random Uncensored" where content is not filtered.

The purpose of Candid is to promote honest conversations. Your posts may be filtered or moved to Random if you post has nothing to do with the group you are posting in.

Of course, slander and libel laws apply, and posts which violate them are prohibited.

Candid has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. This is illegal and absolutely not permitted on Candid.

Like other platforms such as 4chan, complaining about Candid (its policies, moderation, etc) may result in post deletion and a ban. Constructive positive or negative feedback about Candid can be posted to the group Candid Feedback. This rule does not apply to the Random Uncensored group.Impersonating Candid mods is not allowed. Mod posts will have the mod badge displayed.

We actively prevent attempts to compromise our user's privacy or security, including those that use fraud or deception.

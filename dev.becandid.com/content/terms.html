<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The Service and the Software are made available to you for your convenience on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Candid DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, RELIABILITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT) REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OR THE CONTENTS OF THE SERVICE. Candid does not warrant or represent that the Software will be free of all viruses. You understand that the Service and the Software are still alpha/beta versions and may not perform with complete functionality, may add or remove features, may be undergoing testing, may be inconsistently available, may have software "bugs" and may have other issues affecting availability and functionality.</p>
<p>Further, Candid does not warrant or represent that the Service and/or the Software will work on all mobile phones, will be compatible with all mobile phone networks and/or will be available in all geographical areas.</p>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with the Service, or have any other disputes or claims with or against us with respect to the Service or these Terms, then your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Service.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Candid AND ITS PARENT ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (a) ACCESS TO INABILITY TO ACCESS Candid; (b) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD-PARTY ON Candid, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT; (c) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM Candid; OR (d) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT OR TRANSMISSIONS.</p>

<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TWITTER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<h2>Severability</h2>
<p>The failure of Candid or Candid Labs, Inc. to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h2>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with Candid will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using Candid in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</p>
<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms, <a href="community.html">the Candid Community Standards</a>, and <a href="privacy.html">the Candid Privacy Policy</a> are the entire and exclusive agreement between Candid Labs, Inc and you regarding Candid (excluding any services for which you have a separate, written agreement which is explicitly in addition to or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Candid Labs, Inc. and you regarding the use of Candid.</p>
<h2>Notices from Candid</h2>
<p>From time to time, Candid may revise these Terms without notice to you. The most current version will always be at <a href="terms.html">http://becandid.com/terms</a>. We encourage you to check for updated terms on a regular basis, because these terms will apply to you and your account immediately upon posting, whether or not you actually review them.</p>
<p>If you are dissatisfied with or do not agree to abide by any altered Terms of Service, your sole remedy should be to discontinue use of Candid.</p>
